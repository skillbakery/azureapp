# Developing CI/CD Solutions with Azure DevOps
This is the repository for Learning Developing CI/CD Solutions with Azure DevOps.

As a developer, managing a steady stream of requests for new features, updates, and bug fixes is a constant challenge. Azure Pipelines offers a solution by allowing you to construct your applications and identify bugs early in the development process. This course provides a comprehensive guide to configuring a fully automated continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline in Azure. It begins with an in-depth overview of Azure Pipelines concepts, demonstrating the configuration of continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment to specific environments within the Azure Cloud. The content highlights the advantages of these processes and provides insights into securing pipelines for your team's development projects. The course also introduces various features that simplify pipeline configuration and guides you through the definition of a pipeline for building and deploying a .NET solution to the Azure App Service.
